## 📌 Course Coverage

The program combines daily theory, challenges, and real apps to provide hands-on experience with:

- **Swift language fundamentals** — optionals, protocols, extensions, closures, generics, error handling.  
- **SwiftUI essentials** — layouts, state management (`@State`, `@Binding`, `@ObservedObject`), forms, navigation, lists.  
- **Persistence** — `UserDefaults`, Codable, and local data storage.  
- **Networking** — working with `URLSession`, JSON decoding, and building API-driven forms.  
- **Architecture** — MVVM patterns using SwiftUI property wrappers and data flow.  
- **iOS ecosystem** — alerts, gestures, animations, haptics, and integration with system features.
